## Local Development

Browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent you from reading files out of the local file system. To develop locally, you must run a local web server rather than using file://…. Node’s [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is recommended. To install:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

To run:

```
http-server & 
```

This will start the server on <http://localhost:8080> from the current working directory.
